/**
 * A generator of uniform pseudorandom values applicable for use in
 * (among other contexts) isolated parallel computations that may
 * generate subtasks.  Class {@code L64X1024Random} implements
 * interfaces {@link java.util.Rng} and {@link java.util.SplittableRng},
 * and therefore supports methods for producing pseudorandomly chosen
 * numbers of type {@code int}, {@code long}, {@code float}, and {@code double}
 * as well as creating new split-off {@code L64X1024Random} objects,
 * with similar usages as for class {@link java.util.SplittableRandom}.
 *
 * <p>Series of generated values pass the TestU01 BigCrush and PractRand test suites
 * that measure independence and uniformity properties of random number generators.
 * (Most recently validated with
 * <a href="http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/testu01/tu01.html">version 1.2.3 of TestU01</a>
 * and <a href="http://pracrand.sourceforge.net">version 0.90 of PractRand</a>.
 * Note that TestU01 BigCrush was used to test not only values produced by the {@code nextLong()}
 * method but also the result of bit-reversing each value produced by {@code nextLong()}.)
 * These tests validate only the methods for certain
 * types and ranges, but similar properties are expected to hold, at
 * least approximately, for others as well.
 *
 * <p>{@code L64X1024Random} is a specific member of the LXM family of algorithms
 * for pseudorandom number generators.  Every LXM generator consists of two
 * subgenerators; one is an LCG (Linear Congruential Generator) and the other is
 * an Xorshift generator.  Each output of an LXM generator is the sum of one
 * output from each subgenerator, possibly processed by a final mixing function
 * (but {@code L64X1024Random} does not use a mixing function).
 *
 * <p>The LCG subgenerator for {@code L64X1024Random} has an update step of the
 * form {@code s = m * s + a}, where {@code s}, {@code m}, and {@code a} are all
 * of type {@code long}; {@code s} is the mutable state, the multiplier {@code m}
 * is fixed (the same for all instances of {@code L64X1024Random}}) and the addend
 * {@code a} is a parameter (a final field of the instance).  The parameter
 * {@code a} is required to be odd (this allows the LCG to have the maximal
 * period, namely 2<sup>64</sup>); therefore there are 2<sup>63</sup> distinct choices
 * of parameter.
 *
 * <p>The Xorshift subgenerator for {@code L64X1024Random} is the {@code xoroshiro1024}
 * algorithm (parameters 25, 27, and 36), without any final scrambler such as "+" or "**".
 * Its state consists of an array {@code x} of sixteen {@code long} values,
 * which can take on any values provided that they are not all zero.
 * The period of this subgenerator is 2<sup>1024</sup>-1.
 *
 * <p> Because the periods 2<sup>64</sup> and 2<sup>1024</sup>-1 of the two subgenerators
 * are relatively prime, the <em>period</em> of any single {@code L64X1024Random} object 
 * (the length of the series of generated 64-bit values before it repeats) is the product
 * of the periods of the subgenerators, that is, 2<sup>64</sup>(2<sup>1024</sup>-1),
 * which is just slightly smaller than 2<sup>1088</sup>.  Moreover, if two distinct
 * {@code L64X1024Random} objects have different {@code a} parameters, then their
 * cycles of produced values will be different.
 *
 * <p>The 64-bit values produced by the {@code nextLong()} method are exactly equidistributed.
 * For any specific instance of {@code L64X1024Random}, over the course of its cycle each
 * of the 2<sup>64</sup> possible {@code long} values will be produced 2<sup>1024</sup>-1 times.
 * The values produced by the {@code nextInt()}, {@code nextFloat()}, and {@code nextDouble()}
 * methods are likewise exactly equidistributed.
 *
 * <p>In fact, the 64-bit values produced by the {@code nextLong()} method are 16-equidistributed.
 * To be precise: for any specific instance of {@code L64X1024Random}, consider
 * the (overlapping) length-16 subsequences of the cycle of 64-bit values produced by
 * {@code nextLong()} (assuming no other methods are called that would affect the state).
 * There are 2<sup>64</sup>(2<sup>1024</sup>-1) such subsequences, and each subsequence,
 * which consists of 16 64-bit values, can have one of 2<sup>1024</sup> values. Of those
 * 2<sup>1024</sup> subsequence values, nearly all of them (2<sup>1024</sup>-2<sup>64</sup>)
 * occur 2<sup>64</sup> times over the course of the entire cycle, and the other
 * 2<sup>64</sup> subsequence values occur only 2<sup>64</sup>-1 times.  So the ratio
 * of the probability of getting one of the less common subsequence values and the
 * probability of getting one of the more common subsequence values is 1-2<sup>-64</sup>.
 * (Note that the set of 2<sup>64</sup> less-common subsequence values will differ from
 * one instance of {@code L64X1024Random} to another, as a function of the additive
 * parameter of the LCG.)  The values produced by the {@code nextInt()}, {@code nextFloat()},
 * and {@code nextDouble()} methods are likewise 16-equidistributed.
 *
 * <p>Method {@link #split} constructs and returns a new {@code L64X1024Random}
 * instance that shares no mutable state with the current instance. However, with
 * very high probability, the values collectively generated by the two objects
 * have the same statistical properties as if the same quantity of values were
 * generated by a single thread using a single {@code L64X1024Random} object.
 * This is because, with high probability, distinct {@code L64X1024Random} objects
 * have distinct {@code a} parameters and therefore use distinct members of the
 * algorithmic family; and even if their {@code a} parameters are the same, with
 * very high probability they will traverse different parts of their common state
 * cycle.
 *
 * <p>As with {@link java.util.SplittableRandom}, instances of
 * {@code L64X1024Random} are <em>not</em> thread-safe.
 * They are designed to be split, not shared, across threads. For
 * example, a {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask} fork/join-style
 * computation using random numbers might include a construction
 * of the form {@code new Subtask(someL64X1024Random.split()).fork()}.
 *
 * <p>This class provides additional methods for generating random
 * streams, that employ the above techniques when used in
 * {@code stream.parallel()} mode.
 *
 * <p>Instances of {@code L64X1024Random} are not cryptographically
 * secure.  Consider instead using {@link java.security.SecureRandom}
 * in security-sensitive applications. Additionally,
 * default-constructed instances do not use a cryptographically random
 * seed unless the {@linkplain System#getProperty system property}
 * {@code java.util.secureRandomSeed} is set to {@code true}.

    /*
     * Implementation Overview.
     *
     * The split() operation uses the current generator to choose 18 new 64-bit
     * long values that are then used to initialize the parameter `a`, the
     * state variable `s`, and the array `x` for a newly constructed generator.
     *
     * With extremely high probability, no two generators so chosen
     * will have the same `a` parameter, and testing has indicated
     * that the values generated by two instances of {@code L64X1024Random}
     * will be (approximately) independent if have different values for `a`.
     *
     * The default (no-argument) constructor, in essence, uses
     * "defaultGen" to generate 18 new 64-bit values for the same
     * purpose.  Multiple generators created in this way will certainly
     * differ in their `a` parameters.  The defaultGen state must be accessed
     * in a thread-safe manner, so we use an AtomicLong to represent
     * this state.  To bootstrap the defaultGen, we start off using a
     * seed based on current time unless the
     * java.util.secureRandomSeed property is set. This serves as a
     * slimmed-down (and insecure) variant of SecureRandom that also
     * avoids stalls that may occur when using /dev/random.
     *
     * File organization: First static fields, then instance
     * fields, then constructors, then instance methods.
