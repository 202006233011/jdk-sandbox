     *      exact power of two 2<sup><i>m</i></sup> for some integer
     *      <i>m</i>, then return the sum of {@code origin} and the

	// If any salt remains in the word, its right-hand end can be identified

	// bitwise AND is nonzero; if so, one can shift the salt left by
	// SALT_SHIFT and try again.  In this way, when the bitwise OR is
