/**
 * A selectable channel for stream-oriented listening sockets.
 *
 * <p> A server-socket channel is created by invoking one of the open methods of this class.
 * It is not possible to create a channel for an arbitrary,
 * pre-existing {@link ServerSocket}. A newly-created server-socket channel is
 * open but not yet bound.  An attempt to invoke the {@link #accept() accept}
 * method of an unbound server-socket channel will cause a {@link NotYetBoundException}
 * to be thrown. A server-socket channel can be bound by invoking one of the
 * {@link #bind(java.net.SocketAddress,int) bind} methods defined by this class.
 *
 * <p>Two kinds of server-socket channel are supported: <i>IP</i> (Internet Protocol)
 * and <i>Unix Domain</i> depending on which open method is used to create them and which subtype of
 * {@link SocketAddress} that they support for local and remote addresses.
 * <i>IP</i> channels are created using {@link #open()}. They use {@link
 * InetSocketAddress} addresses and support both IPv4 and IPv6 TCP/IP.
 * <i>Unix Domain</i> channels are created using {@link #open(ProtocolFamily)}
 * with the family parameter set to {@link StandardProtocolFamily#UNIX}.
 * They use {@link UnixDomainSocketAddress}es and also
 * do not support the {@link #socket()} method. Note, it is also possible to
 * create channels that support either IPv4 or IPv6 only through the
 * {@link #open(ProtocolFamily)} method.
 *
 * <p> Socket options are configured using the {@link #setOption(SocketOption,Object)
 * setOption} method. <i>IP</i> server-socket channels support the following options:
 * <blockquote>
 * <table class="striped">
 * <caption style="display:none">Socket options</caption>
 * <thead>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th scope="col">Option Name</th>
 *     <th scope="col">Description</th>
 *   </tr>
 * </thead>
 * <tbody>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th scope="row"> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} </th>
 *     <td> The size of the socket receive buffer </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th scope="row"> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} </th>
 *     <td> Re-use address </td>
 *   </tr>
 * </tbody>
 * </table>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.
 *
 * <p> Server-socket channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><i>Unix Domain</i> server-socket channels support a subset of the options listed above.
